 * Patient call history — normalising RingCentral's call-log into something a

 * Pure: no fetching, no React. The RingCentral REST calls live in
 * `lib/fax/ringcentralApi.ts` with the rest of the RC surface; everything that
 * decides *what a record means* is here so it can be tested without a network.
 *
 * ⚠️ The whole reason this file exists is that `result` cannot be read
 * literally. See `callConnected` — a call a rep actually TOOK can arrive with a
 * terminal-looking top-level result, because claiming an inbound call forwards
 * it and tears down the original leg (CLAUDE.md §5.13, the same trap that once
 * flashed "Missed" at the person who had just answered).
